# 3D Printed PCB Holder

This repository contains the design files and print instructions for a **3D Printed PCB Holder**, ideal for electronics prototyping and assembly work. The model is sliced using **Anycubic Cura** and is compatible with most FDM 3D printers.

## 🛠 Features

- Adjustable clamps for holding PCBs of various sizes
- Compact and stable base
- Easy-to-print design with no support required
- Ideal for soldering, inspection, and testing

## 📦 Files Included

- `PCB_Holder.STL` – The 3D model for the holder
- `PCB_Holder.gcode` – Pre-sliced file for Anycubic printers (PLA, 0.2mm layer height)
- `Cura_Profile.curaprofile` – Custom Cura settings used for slicing
